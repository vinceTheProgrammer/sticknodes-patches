        Before creating a new patch request, please keep the following in mind:

        - **Review the contribution guidelines**: Make sure your patch request adheres to it. You can find the guidelines [here](https://github.com/vinceTheProgrammer/sticknodes-patches/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
        - **Do not use the issue page for support**: If you need help or have questions, get in touch with me on Discord @vincetheanimator or start a new [discussion](https://github.com/vinceTheProgrammer/sticknodes-patches/discussions).
